    "license": "All OOI data including data from OOI core sensors and all proposed sensors added\nby Principal Investigators, will be rapidly disseminated, open, and freely\navailable (within constraints of national security). Rapidly disseminated\nimplies that data will be made available as soon as technically feasible, but\ngenerally in near real-time, with latencies as small as seconds for the cabled\ncomponents. In limited cases, individual PIs who have developed a data source\nthat becomes part of the OOI network may request exclusive rights to the data\nfor a period of no more than one year from the onset of the data stream. The\nreliability, quality and completeness of data obtained through OOI are intended\nto be used in an education or research context. It is assumed that outages and\nerrors can occur and are dealt with by the users of the data. These data and\nsoftware are not for use in operational or decision-making settings. The OOI\nprogram makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the data provided are accurate.\nHowever, there may be no Quality Control (QC) performed on data acquired and\nprovided through the OOI program, and there may be no Quality Assurance (QA)\nprovided on information on those data sets. If QC/QA is performed, it is\ndescribed in the metadata.\n\nThe OOI program both produces and, through collaborations within the geosciences\ncommunity, gains access to data sets which may be redistributed either directly\nor indirectly at no cost and with no restrictions.\n\nWith regard to data distribution, all users must comply with any applicable U.S.\nexport laws and regulations. The OOI Program is not responsible for the use of\nthe data it provides. The full data policy is available at\nhttp://oceanobservatories.org/usage-policy.",

    "summary": "The Pioneer Array is located on the continental shelf and slope south of Martha's Vineyard. The shelf-slope area is home to a highly productive ecosystem, and coincident with a persistent ocean frontal system where heat, salt, nutrients and other properties are exchanged between the shelf and the deep ocean. Data from gliders operating over the shelf contribute to understanding of the frontal system while those over the slope provide information about mesoscale features that may impinge on the front. This dataset contains raw Slocum glider data parsed directly from the native glider file format. No corrections or other quality control algorithms have been applied."
